# Code Review Standards

## Purpose

Code review ensures quality, security, and maintainability before code is merged. This rule defines when and how to conduct code reviews.

## When to Review

**MANDATORY review triggers:**

- After writing or modifying code
- Before any commit to shared branches
- When security-sensitive code is changed (auth, payments, user data)
- When architectural changes are made
- Before merging pull requests

**Pre-Review Requirements:**

Before requesting review, ensure:

- All automated checks (CI/CD) are passing
- Merge conflicts are resolved
- Branch is up to date with target branch

## Review Checklist

Before marking code complete:

- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are focused (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are cohesive (<= 150 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Errors are handled explicitly
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] No console.log or debug statements
- [ ] Tests exist for new functionality
- [ ] Test coverage meets 80% minimum

## Security Review Triggers

**STOP and review carefully when:**

- Authentication or authorization code
- User input handling
- External API calls
- Cryptographic operations

## Review Severity Levels

| Level    | Meaning                                  | Action                             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| CRITICAL | Security vulnerability or data loss risk | **BLOCK** - Must fix before merge  |
| HIGH     | Bug or significant quality issue         | **WARN** - Should fix before merge |
| MEDIUM   | Maintainability concern                  | **INFO** - Consider fixing         |
| LOW      | Style or minor suggestion                | **NOTE** - Optional                |

## Review Workflows

Use project-specific review workflows:

- `/code-review` — general code quality, patterns, best practices
- `/react-review` — React/TSX specific issues
- `/a11y-audit` — accessibility

## Review Workflow

```
1. Run git diff to understand changes
2. Check security checklist first
3. Review code quality checklist
4. Run relevant tests
5. Verify coverage >= 80%
6. Use appropriate agent for detailed review
```

## Common Issues to Catch

### Security

- Hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- SQL injection (string concatenation in queries)
- XSS vulnerabilities (unescaped user input)
- Path traversal (unsanitized file paths)
- CSRF protection missing
- Authentication bypasses

### Code Quality

- Large functions (>50 lines) - split into smaller
- Large files (>150 lines) - extract modules
- Deep nesting (>4 levels) - use early returns
- Missing error handling - handle explicitly
- Mutation patterns - prefer immutable operations
- Missing tests - add test coverage

### Performance

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders — keep components focused
- No heavy computation in render — move to hooks or utilities
- Prefer Framer Motion variants over inline animation values

## Approval Criteria

- **Approve**: No CRITICAL or HIGH issues
- **Warning**: Only HIGH issues (merge with caution)
- **Block**: CRITICAL issues found

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works with:

- [testing.md](testing.md) — test coverage requirements
- [security.md](security.md) — security checklist
- [git-workflow.md](git-workflow.md) — commit standards
